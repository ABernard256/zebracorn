In this folder there are two files:

1. `test_purple_holiday_functions.py`
2. `test_orange_holiday_functions.py`

Your assignment is to add **two** test assertions to the file belonging to your
section, following the pattern established in the file.

For the test cases that you add, you must not re-use a test case already used by
another student. In other words, you must contribute **unique** test cases to
the test file. 

You should also try to make your contributions distinct. What this means is, for
example, if you were testing a function like `greater_than(a, b)` and one your
classmates tested `greater_than(10, 1)`, and another tested `greater_than(11,
1)` then you shouldn't add the test `greater_than(12, 1)`. You should instead
test a different condition, like `greater_than(1, 10)`.

These test files use assert statements. If the expression in an assert statement
is false, then the program throws an error and stops executing immediately.
