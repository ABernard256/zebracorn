# Task 0004: Digital homework confirmations

This task puts you on record for having completed the first three homework
assignments.

Do not complete this task if you have not done the first three homework
assignments.

The first three homework assignments are critical to the quiz. This is why 
I want clear confirmation from students whether or not they did it.

At the root of this repo, there is a folder called [homework_confirmations](../homework_confirmations).
Underneath that folder, you'll find three files:

1. bits_and_bytes.txt
2. more_complex_representations.txt
3. digital_logic.txt

Each of those files asks you to add a statement next to your name. Only
add the statement if it is true. 

Use what you've learned in the previous tasks to use github.com to make
your changes to the files and commit those changes to the repo.
