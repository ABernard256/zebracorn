# Task 0003: Test Holiday Functions

This task is an add-on to the assignment in My Groton labeled "Variables,
Procedural Decomposition, and Conditional Execution."

In this task, each section of the class will work together collectively to
create one big test file that we will run against each student's
`holiday_functions.py` file to test it for accuracy. So the purple section will
create one test file that we will run for all code submissions in the purple
section. And the orange section will likewise create its own test file.

Completing this task successfully will be a part of your grade for the homework
assignment. Your overall grade for the assignment will be based on the number of
points you obtain, as follows:

| Type | Points |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Completion âœ… | 3 points for doing the homework assigned in My Groton |
| Completion âœ… | 3 points for adding three test cases (explained below) |
| Accuracy ðŸŽ¯ | 1 point if all of your holiday functions pass all the tests (0 points if there is any failure) | 
| Accuracy ðŸŽ¯ | 1 point if your test code is correct (meaning the teacher does not have to correct your test code) |

Your grade = number of points you earn divided by the total number of points
possible (8). 

The rest of the instructions for this task are in the [test_holiday_functions](../test_holiday_functions)
folder.
