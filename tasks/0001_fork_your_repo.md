# Task 0001: Fork or create your repo

If you already have a repo under `mgnozzio` then continue on to the section "Fork your repo."

If you do **not** already have such a repo, skip to the bottom, to the section "Create your repo."

## Fork your repo

Your first task is to fork your repo from under `mgnozzio` to your own account.

If you don't know what a "fork" is, and you're curious, consult the GitHub docs.

### Step 1

Go to your repo under `mgnozzio`.

### Step 2

Click the button labeled "Fork," shown in the screenshot below.

### Step 3

Rename the repository. 

Right now, your repo name is formed by the first letter of your first name plus
your last name plus the last two digits of your graduation year. I suggest
giving it a more descriptive name, like "cswinter" or whatever makes most sense
to you, as shown in the following screenshot.

### Step 4

After a second or two, GitHub should fork your repo and take you to the home
page for the fork that you just created. 

Once the home page for your fork has loaded, go to the repo Settings page. The
link is in the top nav bar, as shown in the screenshot:

### Step 5

Go to Collaborators and click the "Add people" button.

### Step 6

A dialog modal should pop up with a search box and a submit button, like so:

![](https://github.com/gabalafou/zebracorn/assets/317883/3791b857-0db1-4b74-adff-e6401d03347f)

In the search box, type `gabalafou`. From the dropdown, select the GitHub
account for Gabriel Fouasnon, gabalafou. Then click the green button. It should say "Add
gabalafou to this repository."

## Create your repo

If you do not already have a repo under `mgnozzio`, then your task is to create
a GitHub username first if you do not already have one, and then create a
**private** repo under your GitHub username. GitHub has great documentation, so
try doing this on your own before asking for help. You can name the repo
"cswinter" or any name that makes sense to you. This repo will be where you
submit nearly all of your assignments for this class.
